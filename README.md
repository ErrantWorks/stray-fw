# strayFw

The strayFw is yet another PHP framework which is trying to present few things differently.

* Homepage : inc
* Version : beta - 0.1-Albrecht

Yes, it's loosely based on MVC architecture. Yes, again. But, again, we try to change a few things.
We don't think it's a revolutionary framework. We just try to do different. Maybe you will like the
way too.

Code is free, new-BSD license. So... fork us !
